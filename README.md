# Generation of the unique identifier is done using Java and Mysql.
Each time a new batch number is inputed the corresponding batch number
and the unique id is stored into the database.So when we give the same
batch number again, it just checks the table and the unique id is printed.
The code is written in java and I used hibernate for the backend sql
coding.

To run this program just download the company file and import it in the eclipse 
and if you already have connection to mysql then just run the code.
